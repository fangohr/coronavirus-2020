# What about errors in the data?

* The data we have available is likely to be in accurate:
  - Infections can only be confirmed if they are being tested: the more testing
    takes place, the more infected people can be found. Asymptomatic individuals
    may not be tested if tests are prioritised for severely sick, health workers
    or those showing symptoms.
  - Tests may be inaccurate and report false positives or false negatives.
  - Deaths may be easier to detect than infections, but may also be inaccurate.
  - The reporting of cases and deaths may not take place during weekends, or
    there may be delays for other reasons.
  
* Despite the errors in the data, we can try to learn something from it as long
  as we remember the data is not representing the full truth of the situation
  but just the measurement that we have available.
  
  * For some plots, we have omitted data lines or points because there were not
    enough numbers and data points to estimate anything.
    
  * Some data points appear random or as outliers - for some we understand the
    reasons, for others not.
    
* It is possible we have made errors in our processing of the numbers. The
  source code is available for anyone to check. (Please feedback any
  observations.)
