  [ideas](https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020/blob/master/ideas.md) for
  further analysis and features that would be nice or useful.

* For those with programming and software engineering skills, there is a
  document
  [info.md](https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020/blob/master/info.md)
  with more details about the project and a [todo
  list](https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020/blob/master/todo.md).
  
* Bugs and ideas can be reported as a ["New
  issue"](https://github.com/oscovida/feedback/issues) - a
