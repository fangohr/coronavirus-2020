Welcome to the Open Science COVID19 Analysis page! Read about our
`motivation <motivation.html>`__, `data sources <data-sources.html>`__,
`team <team.html>`__. Use our analysis plots of COVID19 cases and deaths
to better understand the development of the pandemic and measures taken.
Or use `our code and extend the analysis <open-science.html>`__ for your
own purposes, or to share here.

We provide a `standard a set of analysis plots <plots.html>`__ for different regions:

-  `List of all regions <all-regions.html>`__ (different data sources)

-  `Overview for each country in the world <countries.html>`__ (Johns Hopkins data)
   
-  `States in the US <us.html>`__ (Johns Hopkins data)

-  `Counties (Landkreise) in Germany <germany.html>`__ (Robert Koch Institute data)

Occasionally, we try to `put COVID19 numbers reported in the news into context <tag-numbers-in-news.html>`__.
