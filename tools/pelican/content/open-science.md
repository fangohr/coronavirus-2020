To use the analysis provided here, some Python knowledge is required, ideally
additional experience (or willingness to learn) about the Pandas data science
library and the Jupyter Notebook.

## Source code
All the computational steps and code are available
[here](https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020/blob/master/coronavirus.py).

## Ways to use and execute the source code

* If you know your way around Github, you can fork the repository.

* Or you download the
  [coronavirus.py](https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020/blob/master/coronavirus.py)
  Python program, and execute it on your own machine. We provide some Jupyter Notebook templates.
  
* All of the plots and tables can be recomputed using the Binder service (link
  in each webpage with plots and data, or use [go here and select the relevant
  notebook yourself](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/coronavirus/master)
  
  This will provide a fully functional computing environment, that can be used
  from your browser.
