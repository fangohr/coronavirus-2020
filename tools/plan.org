* Open questions Germany
** Laender
- For Hamburg, there is only one entry in the table (Hamburg, SK Hamburg)
- Would be nice to get a summary for Bayern - this is missing at the moment?

** Bug?
- the daily changes in log scale plot shows strips in y-direction, for example
  wwwroot/Germany-Baden-WuÌˆrttemberg-LK-Alb-Donau-Kreis.html
 
What is this? (accidentally dropping rows inplace?)
