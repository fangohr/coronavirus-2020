## Prediction deaths

| Prediction date | 1-day ahead predicted | actual | 10 days ahead predicted | actual        |
| --------------- | ---------------------:| ------:|------------------------:|--------------:|
| 31 Jan 2020     | 262                   | 258    | 1072                    |               |

Prediction on 31 January is based on data collected on 30 January. The 1-day ahead prediction is thus predicting 
the numbers from 31 Jan (which typically become available only the next day).
