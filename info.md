Info on data sources, repository and software details
========================================================

Data for Germany from Robert Koch Institute
----------------------------------------------------

-   From <https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/> -\> Menu top
    left -\> \"Data\", scroll down to \"RKI Corona Landkreise\" data
    set, -\> select interesting data set -\> for example
    -   RKI Corona BundeslÃ¤nder
    -   RKI COVID19 -\> RKI Corona Landkreise
    -   Download button (below image, on the right) -\> Full Data set
        -\> Spreadsheet This provides a link to a csv file, but with a
        URL that includes a hash. As of 9 April, this is
        <https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ef4b445a53c1406892257fe63129a8ea_0.csv>


Overall set up of directory structure and software
==================================================

Directory structure for repository
<https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020>:

coronavirus-2020 (root dir of repository)
-----------------------------------------

contains `coronavirus.py` as the main file required to create the plots

-   notebooks will import from this or use %run to execute it
-   this is the authorative copy of coronavirus.py

Also contains `index.ipynb` and `germany.ipynb` as the initial way of
presenting the plots. They can probably be replaced by the static
webpages, or be used to show some particular interesting data sets.

Other files:

-   [info.md](info.md) : this file, provides overview of current setup
-   [todo.md](todo.md) : things that need doing (programming/software
    engineering/data analysis)
-   [ideas.md](ideas.md): things that could be done; might need some evaluation
    first

coronavirus-2020/tools
----------------------

contains tools to create static webpages at
<https://fangohr.github.io/coronavirus>, (repository to host webpages is
<https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020>)

in particular:

-   generate-countries.ipynb Notebook that creates all the static
    wepages for the world, and Germany

-   template-country.ipynb (used for world countries)
-   template-germany.ipynb (used for Germany)

Hack: to run `generate-countries.ipynb` we copy at the beginning, the
`coronavirus.py` file from the parent directory. Important to remember
that the authorative file is in the parent directory.

coronavirus-2020/tools/wwwroot
------------------------------

-   rootdirectory of <https://fangohr.github.io/coronavirus> and
    repository

-   files that are added to the repository
    <https://github.com/fangohr/coronavirus-2020>, and then pushed, will
    show up at <https://fangohr.github.io/coronavirus> a few minutes
    later

-   we use a separate repository (I.e. different from code repo) out of
    fear that it may grow quickly in size. At that point, we can create
    a new repository under the same name, as the history is pretty
    irrelevant: this is only to serve the most recent data in static
    html files.

-   The total size of html file for world and Germany is around 300MB,
    but the .git directory is smaller.

-   The files committed to the webpages repository must contain the most
    recent `coronavirus.py` and `requirements.txt` as those are needed
    by binder to execute the notebooks.

-   By also commiting the `cachedir`, people don\'t need to re-fetch the
    data on the binder service (fetching of the German data set varies
    between 1s and 60 seconds).

coronavirus-2020/archive
------------------------

-   files for history interest - can be removed soon. There were
    initially interesting to look up some things tried before.

coronavirus-2020/dev
--------------------

-   ongoing development

        -   nice comparison of trajectories
            -   would be good to have per state or \'Landkreis\'
