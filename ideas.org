* Priorities
- provide local data (Germany, Land (state), Landkreise)
- open source (All source is available, Binder)

* Curve your city / country
Useful plots:
- total deaths in log scale
- total cases in log scale
- new cases per day (normal scale)
- new deaths per day (normal scale)
- doubling time on these plots
  - based on day-to-day difference is probably too noisy
    - average over last n days?
    - or fit exponential function through n days to get one data point?

- also show data in numbers per million (or per 1000?)

Useful fits:
- fit through data from last n days (n between 3 and 21, 10 might be a good
  default) and extrapolate for the future
  - use error margin in fit estimate as shown at 
  - allow user to vary n

Compare countries and strategies
- compare with China, Italy and other countries
  - use deaths where possible 
  - fit model function to china data, so we can fit it to other data and compare?
    - sigmoidal
  -> estimate total infect / deaths?

- investigate numbers in China, South Korea and Singapore - what are the
  'positive signs' we are looking for?

* Other topics
- fewer reported cases over the weekends

* Presentation
Jupyter notebooks that can 
- be seen as static data and be interesting in their own right
- executable through Binder (open science aspect)
- use Voila for interactive exploration (need to run on some kind of binder host??)

- Jupyter notebooks as templates: https://covid19dashboards.com/
  One of these is 
  - https://covid19dashboards.com/compare-country-death-trajectories/
    - nice comparison of trajectories
      - would be good to have per state or 'Landkreis'
