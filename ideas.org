* Basics
** What is exponential growth
** How do we characterise it
- grow factor
- doubling time
** How do we compute it?
- for example doubling time: (probably expert topic)
  - take two points
  - fit curve through more points
  - go back from last value and look for when numbers are half
** What are the inaccuracies?
- confirmed cases
  - not testing enough
  - tests may give wrong positives and negatives

* Curve your city / country
Useful plots:
- total deaths in log scale
- total cases in log scale
- new cases per day (normal scale)
- new deaths per day (normal scale)
- doubling time on these plots
  - based on day-to-day difference is probably too noisy
    - average over last n days?
    - or fit exponential function through n days to get one data point?

- also show data in numbers per million (or, I prefer, per 1000)

Useful fits:
- fit through data from last n days (n between 3 and 21, 10 might be a good
  default) and extrapolate for the future
  - allow user to vary n

Compare countries and strategies
- compare with China, Italy and other countries
  - use deaths where possible 
  - fit model function to china data, so we can fit it to other data and compare?
    - sigmoidal
  -> estimate total infect / deaths?

* Other topics
- fewer reported cases over the weekends
- investigate numbers in China, South Korea and Singapore 
* Presentation
Jupyter notebooks that can 
- be seen as static data and be interesting in their own right
- executable through Binder (open science aspect)
- use Voila for interactive exploration (need to run on some kind of binder host??)
