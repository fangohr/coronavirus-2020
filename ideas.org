* Priorities
- [X] set of plots to start from (see index.ipynb)
- [ ] provide local data (Germany, Land (state), Landkreise)
  - [ ] are the same plots still usable
- [ ] show data with more interactive technology (plotly?)
- select data set by clicking on landkreis? (possible? Use voila?)
- [X] open source (All source is available, Binder)
- [ ] compare growth in different areas
  - focus around point of 100 infections
  - loglog plot (Hans has example)
- [ ] add growth factor to plots (Robert's suggestion)
  - try running average on top
  - maybe can add this to daily change plots?

* Minor fixes
- label subplots in index.ipynb (1, 2, 3, 4 ?)
- adjust plot size to make sure headline shows in svg/pdf files when saved
* Curve your city / country
Useful plots:
- [X] total deaths in log scale
- [X] total cases in log scale
- [X] new cases per day (normal scale)
- [X] new deaths per day (normal scale)
- [X] doubling time on these plots
  - based on day-to-day difference is probably too noisy
    - average over last n days?
    - or fit exponential function through n days to get one data point?
    - rolling average works well

- [ ] also show data in numbers per million (or per 1000?)


* Other topics
- fewer reported cases over the weekends -> fourier transform to confirm?

- Compare countries and strategies
  - compare with China, Italy and other countries
    - fit model function to china data, so we can fit it to other data and compare?
      - sigmoidal
    -> estimate total infect / deaths?
  
  - investigate numbers in China, South Korea and Singapore - what are the
    'positive signs' we are looking for?

* Presentation
Jupyter notebooks that can 
- [X] be seen as static data and be interesting in their own right
  - [ ] or have plain html for faster loading and being more accessible to a broader audience?
- [X] executable through Binder (open science aspect)

* Related resources
- https://nextstrain.org/ncov
- Jupyter notebooks as templates: https://covid19dashboards.com/
  One of these is 
  - https://covid19dashboards.com/compare-country-death-trajectories/
    - nice comparison of trajectories
      - would be good to have per state or 'Landkreis'

** Data about Germany
- Germany Government? https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/ -> Menu top
  left -> "Data", scroll down to "RKI Corona Landkreise" data set, -> select
  interesting data set -> for example
  - RKI Corona BundeslÃ¤nder
  - RKI COVID19 -> RKI Corona Landkreise
  - Download button (below image, on the right) -> Full Data set -> Spreadsheet
    This provides a link to a csv file, but with a URL that includes a hash, something like 
    https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/917fc37a709542548cc3be077a786c17_0.csv
